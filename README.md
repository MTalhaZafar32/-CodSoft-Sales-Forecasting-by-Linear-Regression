# Sales Forecasting by Linear Regression

Welcome to the "Sales Forecasting by Linear Regression" project repository! This Python project focuses on predicting sales using Linear Regression. The goal is to develop a predictive model for sales based on various advertising channels, as explored in the 'advertising.csv' dataset.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build a sales forecasting model using Linear Regression. The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Exploration:** In this stage, we explore the 'advertising.csv' dataset to understand its characteristics, relationships between variables, and trends.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing includes tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering. We prepare the data for modeling.

3. **Linear Regression Model:** We develop a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising spending through different channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper).

4. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) to assess its accuracy and reliability.

5. **Saving Predictions:** The final sales predictions are saved to 'sales_prediction.csv.'

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
Sales-Forecasting-by-Linear-Regression/
├── data/
│ ├── advertising.csv
│ ├── sales_prediction.csv
├── notebooks/
│ ├── Sales_Working_File.ipynb
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
```

- The `data/` directory contains the 'advertising.csv' dataset and 'sales_prediction.csv' with sales predictions.
- The `notebooks/` directory includes the Jupyter notebook 'Sales_Working_File.ipynb,' where you can find data analysis, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MTalhaZafar32/CodSoft-Sales-Forecasting-by-Linear-Regression.git
2. Install Dependencies: If there are any specific Python dependencies required for the project, you can install them.

3. Explore the Data: Navigate to the data/ directory to find the 'advertising.csv' dataset containing information about advertising spending and corresponding sales.

4. Notebook Analysis: Open the notebooks/Sales_Working_File.ipynb notebook to view the data analysis, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

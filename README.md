# Sales Forecasting by Linear Regression

Welcome to the "Sales Forecasting by Linear Regression" project repository! This Python project focuses on predicting sales using Linear Regression. The goal is to develop a predictive model for sales based on various advertising channels, as explored in the 'advertising.csv' dataset.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build a sales forecasting model using Linear Regression. The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Exploration:** In this stage, we explore the 'advertising.csv' dataset to understand its characteristics, relationships between variables, and trends.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing includes tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering. We prepare the data for modeling.

3. **Linear Regression Model:** We develop a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising spending through different channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper).

4. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) to assess its accuracy and reliability.

5. **Saving Predictions:** The final sales predictions are saved to 'sales_prediction.csv.'
